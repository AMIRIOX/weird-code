# weird-code

[English]() | [Chinese](README.md)

Contains some weird codes, of course most of them are non-standard,So please don't open compile options like `-Werror`

All code is tested under `clang++ 10.0.0`,

```bash
$ clang++ {filename}.cpp -o {exename}.exe
% clang++ {filename}.cpp -o {exename}.exe
> clang++ {filename}.cpp -o {exename}.exe

./{exename}.exe
```

If you think the above is a little troublesome, ~~ is really fucking troublesome~~, you can compile through `cmpl.sh` under the `code` folder, provided you have `clang++` or ` g++` either.

```bash
$ cd code
$ cmpl {filename}.cpp
# Then the folder tests will be automatically created 
# and the results of the execution
# after compilation will be output
```

If you have questions about the code, please contact [wumingyun2120@outlook.com](mailto:wumingyun2120@outlook.com)
