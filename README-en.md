# weird-code

[English]() | [Chinese](README.md)

Contains some weird codes, of course most of them are non-standard,So please don't open compile options like `-Werror`

All code is tested under `clang++ 10.0.0`,

```bash
$ clang++ {filename}.cpp -o {exename}.exe
% clang++ {filename}.cpp -o {exename}.exe
> clang++ {filename}.cpp -o {exename}.exe
```
